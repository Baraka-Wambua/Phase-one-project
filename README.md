 # Phase-one-project
 
 
## Overview.            
* Provided with data of aviation accidents from the National Transportation Safety Board, The project aims at using the relevant methods of data analysis to come up with findings that help in determining which Aircraft carry the lowest risk.

## About the Business.
* The stake holder wishes to expand the business and venture into a new industry of purchasing and operating aircrafts. The operation aims at both commercial and private enterprises.
* With the data provided,an analysis has to be done:
  * WHich Make of aircraft are the lowest risk ?
  * Which Air craft is mostly damaged incase of an acccident?
  * What is the best type of engine for our desired Aircraft?

      ##  Data.
* The dataset from  the National Transportation Society Board contains accident from 1962 to 2023. the data consists of civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and International waters.

  ## Method of Analysis.
* The dataset is reduced into the relevant columns for the analysis.
* Null values arer filled up.
* The rows that are duplicates are dropped.
* New columns are created out of the existing data.

  #### First we Check out how Many total fatalities have been experienced by each make so far.

  * A graph showing total fatalities that are experienced by the to air craft makes.

  * A graph showing Total number of those who were uninjured in the accidents experienced by certain aircraft make.

* A Pie chart showing the most used type of engine in the top 10 arcraft.

## Conclusions.

* Both boeing and Air bus have experienced high number of fatalities over   the years.
* Despite Boeing And Airbus having the highest number of total deaths, they also lead in the number of survivors in the accidents.                                                         
* Among the top 8 Aircraft, Cessna had the least amount of fatal injuries as well as the highest number of those who were uninjured.                                                       
* The most used type of engine is Reciprocating engine .

  ## Recommendations.
*It is recommended that the company considers buying Boeing that has reciprocating  type of engine.                                                                                    
*The second aircraft to put into consideration is Boeing that has reciprocating type of engine.
